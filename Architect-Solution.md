Hi Lilly,

Thank you for reaching out to us regarding the challenges you've been facing with your Faster web application. I'm thrilled to assist you in designing an architecture that aligns with your current needs and future growth plans.

Considering your startup status and the flexibility to make changes to your application stack, we recommend leveraging AWS Elastic Beanstalk for its seamless deployment and scaling capabilities. Elastic Beanstalk supports Python applications, offers built-in autoscaling, and facilitates Blue/Green deployments to minimize downtime during updates.

Here's a proposed architecture using AWS services:

Route 53: Utilize Route 53 for DNS management to route traffic to your application hosted on Elastic Beanstalk.

Elastic Load Balancing: Employ Elastic Load Balancing to distribute incoming traffic across multiple instances within your Elastic Beanstalk environment, ensuring high availability and improved performance.

Elastic Beanstalk with Autoscaling EC2 Group: Deploy your Python and Flask application on Elastic Beanstalk, which will automatically handle the deployment, capacity provisioning, load balancing, and scaling of your application based on traffic demand.

Amazon RDS: Migrate your PostgreSQL database to Amazon RDS for easy management, scalability, automated backups, and high availability using Multi-AZ deployment.

Amazon S3: Store static content such as images, CSS, and JavaScript files in Amazon S3, which can be served directly to users or via Amazon CloudFront for improved latency and global distribution.

CodePipeline: Implement AWS CodePipeline for continuous integration and continuous delivery (CI/CD) to automate the deployment process of your application updates to Elastic Beanstalk, ensuring rapid and reliable delivery with minimal downtime.

While Elastic Beanstalk is a recommended solution for its simplicity and scalability, it's important to note that AWS offers a range of services that may suit your specific requirements. We're committed to exploring alternative options and discussing their pros and cons before finalizing the design. Whether it's Lambda for serverless computing, Fargate for containerized workloads, or other services tailored to your needs, we're here to guide you through the decision-making process.

Please let me know your thoughts on the proposed architecture, and feel free to reach out with any questions or additional requirements you may have. We're excited to collaborate with you on optimizing your Faster web application's performance and reliability.

Best regards,

Aakarshit Srivastava
